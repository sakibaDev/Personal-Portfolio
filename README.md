# Personal-Portfolio

This is a responsive personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website showcases my professional profile, including my projects, skills, education, and contact information. It is designed with a clean and modern layout, ensuring a user-friendly experience across all devices. I used Bootstrap to simplify responsiveness and layout structure, along with custom CSS for unique styling elements. This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and gain hands-on experience in building responsive web interfaces.
